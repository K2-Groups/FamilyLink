# Home is where hope grows
FamilyLink aims to reduce the number of orphans in orphanages by providing support to single parents and grandparents who are taking care of their children or grandchildren. Through our platform, we will connect those in need with resources such as financial assistance, counseling, and legal support to help them provide a stable and nurturing home environment for their children. Our goal is to empower families to stay together and prevent unnecessary separations that lead to children being placed in orphanages.

> Bringing Families Home: Join us in the fight to keep families together and give orphans a loving home.
